Buildserver
===========
This is a complete development environment provisioned with Ansible+Vagrant.

The build server on Centos is provisioned with Vagrant and Ansible. It uses several roles published on http://galaxy.ansible.com.
**Java, Ant, Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Sonar, Nexus, Artifactory with MariaDB as database.**
It comes fully configure with the example project (game-of-life) of the book "Jenkins, the Definitive Guide". That is an [open source book](http://www.wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide).
Plugins for Jenkins and Sonar are provisioned from specs in roles/jenkins/vars/main.yml and roles/sonar/vars/main.yml.

**Tomcat+PostgreSQL** are deployed on a separate VM to mimic production.

**Windows 7 IE 10** is used for post-deployment testing.
